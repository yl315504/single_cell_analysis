Please add the Seurat scRNAseq pipeline to ls6 using the yaml file in the folder attached.
The Stage0 to 4 should be standardized. But the later 2 stages might need tweaks which I will be emailing you guys.

# Install the environment. Run this command in the directory with Seurat_mchgd.yaml file.
conda env update -n Seurat --file Seurat_mchgd.yaml
